# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### This project aims to "categorize and examine crowdfunding data to decide that certain elements make the Kickstarter successful."

### To arrive at a conclusion, we spread the information into three categories; Successful, Failed, and canceled campaigns.  We used the tools and formulas we were provided, such as Vlookup, =years, and =sum formulas, to find the needed information.  We created graphs and pivot tables to give a visual indication of the information that we needed. The most challenging problem I faced was trying to use the =years function and trying to gather data from the date created conversion, luckily I just had to add the correct cell in the formula to get the appropriate years for the column, Along with help from the tutoring center to effortlessly explain what I was doing wrong.

### Two Conclusions I came up with about the outcomes based on launch date are that the best months to launch a campaign are between March and May.

The graph shows a massive spike between March and May.  From the end of May, you notice a slow decline until December.

### From the look of this Line Graph, I concluded on the Outcomes based on Goals that there is a corresponding similarity between the number of successful and failed campaigns. I also found no data on the canceled movements, so I can not provide any information. Also, the failed and canceled campaigns meet on the same line rough around 40% through 60%.

### The restrictions of this dataset were quite a hassle; it does not provide you any information about the people who did these campaigns.  All through, the dataset includes great information presenting real-life experiences.  Which can help Louise with her own projects in the future.

### There are tons of tables and graphs we could create, such as a bar graph or a pie graph, to provide even more concise information on how successful campaigns were with the specific budget they were required to meet. Or creating a histogram using a histogram can provide information on how many campaigns were successful, from the smallest budget to the most significant funding.
